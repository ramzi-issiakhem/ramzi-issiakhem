# 👋 Hi, I’m Ramzi — Fullstack Laravel & Vue.js Engineer

I’m a fullstack Software Engineer specialized in Laravel, Vue.js, and Docker. I help early-stage startups and entrepreneurs build and launch their MVPs, internal tools, or SaaS platforms, from backend APIs to full dashboards. With a solid grasp of DevOps and business logic, I take care of everything from architecture to deployment. Whether you’re technical or not, I’ll translate your vision into a robust product that works and scales.

I specialize in:
- 💻 Laravel backend development (Filament, REST APIs, authentication, etc.)
- ⚙️ DevOps practices with Docker and CI/CD
- 🌐 Frontend development using Vue.js and Tailwind

I care about business logic, performance, and maintainability — not just code.
